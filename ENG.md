It has been almost 25 years since some of us met at a Congress in Sahagún, commemorating the centenary of Fray Bernardino de Sahagún. This contact was followed by conferences in Toulouse, in Madrid, and we could say the emergence of the Polish group. We have organized many conferences together, some published, we have organized and/or attended seminars and conferences, and there have been stays at each other's universities. We have grown in number of people and quality of work to the point that I believe I can affirm that the group contains leading researchers in the topics we deal with.

This growth has included the incorporation of new researchers, the completion of their doctoral theses, and the search for academic stabilization, always problematic. In fact, the proposal to create a network that certifies international links to its members arose from a conversation in which it was proposed how we could collaborate to improve the perspectives of new researchers, and in the process, value everything that we have. we have been doing together these years.

Most of you have given an affirmative and even enthusiastic response to this initiative, so it seems time to move to the next level. What can we and what do we want to do?
